        <p><br><strong>Leogo</strong> is a curated e-commerce marketplace that spotlights the work of local BIPOC merchants. It was born of both necessity and inspiration.</p></br>
        <p>Working in ecommerce for half a dozen years has afforded me the opportunity to spend zillions of hours on the internet looking at many sites and internalize what is and what isn’t well represented in the market as well as an in depth understanding of best practices and what consumers seem to gravitate to. A couple of major takeaways I had were first that experience matters. UX is not just a trend, it is essential to consumer confidence; It makes people excited about visiting your site and keeps them there.</p>
        <p>Secondly, as democratizing e-commerce has been for small and medium sized businesses, there is still a need to hunt to find smaller shops run by underrepresented groups in my local market. Inspired by the work that amazing organizations like <a href="https://15percentpledge.org/"><i id="about-link"></i>The Fifteen Percent Pledge</i></a> and <a href="https://blackdesignersofcanada.com/"><i id="about-link">The Black Designers of Canada</i></a> directory are doing, I set out to create a marketplace to bring together some of the amazing offerings from entrepreneurs and artisans of racialized groups into a well designed and palatable digital space with universal appeal. The ultimate goal is to create a community where everyone is welcome to explore and discover beautiful unique hand-crafted and inspired products made by talented black and indigenous people of color.</p> 
        <p>The name Leogo is trivial.  It is a brand name I created over a decade ago for my dream clothing line.  I enjoyed drawing clothes as a stress reliever and creative outlet, with no intention of producing them. They were imaginative, colorful and the sort of wardrobe pieces I would wear in my fantasy life that were both glamorous and simple and everything in between.  “Leogo” is an amalgamation of two astrological signs- “Leo”, and “Virgo”.  As a proud Virgo myself, I wanted to create a word conveyed a feeling and had no literal meaning.  It symbolizes the time of year from August to September that is still warm and relaxing with glimpses of the crisp refreshing season to come.  It's an anticipatory season, and that is what this project is about.  While this is only a working prototype at the moment it is the look and feel of a concept that I hope to be much more one day.</p>
